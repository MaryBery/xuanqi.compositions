# xuanqi.compositions

I created this site for a composer and artist as a way for her to display her works for potential clients.
It's programmed with both an English setting and a Chinese setting, for her career shall take place in both America and China. The setting changes with a button at the top right that says the language to which it would change.
The music page has music files which a person can stream (though only the first one is present as the files for the other two are too big for GitHub to hold and there is not an online version to which the page can link).
On the drawings page, there is a navigation palette at the top to quickly zoom to a specific artwork on the page.
The about page displays both her autobiography and her résumé. 
The site was coded in html, css, and JScript.
